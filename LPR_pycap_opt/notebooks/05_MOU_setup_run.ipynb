    " -  `pump_lbound_fraction` is a lower bound on pumping, applied to each well used in the optimization. This takes the form of a fraction (typically between 0.0 and 1.0) to be multiplied by the baseline pumping rate to form a lower bound. *  \n",
    " -  `pump_ubound_fraction` is an upper bound on pumping, applied to each well used in the optimization. This takes the form of a fraction (typically around 1.0, but can be selected) to be multiplied by the baseline pumping rate to form a lower bound. \n",
    " - `objectives` determined what the multiple objectives to be optimized for are. You can make more custom versions of this, but currently three options are supported:\n",
    "    - `depletion_q` aims to _minimize_ depletion (in CFS) and _maximize_ agricultural pumping (in CFS)\n",

    "- `depletion_potential_threshold` is a threshold (in the range of 0.0 to 1.0) of depletion potential below which wells are not managed for optimization. In other words, if a well's depletion potential falls below the threshold, it is maintained at its original baseline pumping rate throughout the optimization process. A spatial analysis can help guide this decision - see notebook `01_Calculate_Depletion_Potential.ipynb` for guidance.\n",
