## Curriculum Plan
 1. Read about the area.  Consider different water users.  If there was a reduction in water availability, come up with three schemes to 'fairly' reapportion water.   
 2. Consider the MODFLOW model without running it - just to understand the system.  Discuss how they could implement one of their strategies (maybe give one to each of five groups).  Talk about limitations with respect to computational effort.  
 3. Introduce the analytical solution.  Ideally, show them a comparison of the solution with pumping from one well.  Then, perhaps, show them that the analytical solution is close, even if it isn't perfect, for multiple interfering wells.  Determine if the system is oversubscribed and, if so, by how much.  Implement their one strategy using the analytical solution and superposition to develop a 'cost' versus increase of in-stream water.  
 4. Consider three strategies - including a new strategy if they can think of one at this point.  Identify 'winners' and 'losers' from implementing this strategy over others.  Make a clear case for which is preferred that you will present, in particular, to those who lose out!  
 5. Write up the assessment, including a justification for the strategy chosen in contrast to others considered.  Include a general discussion of the potential uses of groundwater models in resource sharing.  In particular, focus on potential pitfalls - some of which they explain how to avoid them, others that they think may be unavoidable.
